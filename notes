BITWISE
AND &
    result is 1 when both bits are 1
OR |
    result is 0 when both bits are 0
EXC OR ^
NOT ~
    resut is 0 when 1, 1 when 0
LEFT SHIFT whose bits get shifted << decides the nbr of places to shift the bits
    left shifting equiv. to multiplication by 2^rightOperand
    3 << 1 = 3 x 2^1 = 6

ascii value in binary is the same as ascii char

How do I find the PID of a signal sender?
